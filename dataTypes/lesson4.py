#dynamic type
name = "Jimmy"

name = "Steven" #it will change the value of name from "Jimmy" to "Steven"

#even you assign integer value to variable name, it will printed in the terminal
#that's why its call dynamic type 
#different from C++ that we must declare our variable's data type first, its called static type
